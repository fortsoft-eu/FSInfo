# FSInfo
*Simple utility to show RTF file content.*

**FSInfo** is a simple *Windows application* to display short information stored
in an *RTF file*. The *RTF file* must be named **"FSInfo.rtf"** and must be
stored in the same directory as **"FSInfo.exe"**.

**FSInfo cannot open** any other file from a different location or with a
different name and is therefore not intended to replace *rich text editors*.
**FSInfo is intended** only for displaying a short note, for example,
information about some configuration, which only needs to be displayed, read, or
copied for further use and closed. **FSInfo** does not store any information
anywhere on the target computer, such as the position or size of the window. The
application does not require installation on the target computer, it only
requires **.NET Framework** to run.

Target framework has been changed from **.NET Framework 4.6** in version
**1.0.0.2** to **.NET Framework 4 Client Profile** in current version
**1.1.0.0** for backward compatibility with **Windows XP Service Pack 3**.

**FSInfo** is released under the **MIT license**.
