# FSInfo
*Simple utility to show RTF file content.*

**FSInfo is** a simple *Windows application* to display short information stored
in an *RTF file*. The *RTF file* must be named **"FSInfo.rtf"** and stored in
the same directory as **"FSInfo.exe**".

**FSInfo** cannot open any other file from a different location or with a
different name and is, therefore, not intended to replace *rich text editors*.
**FSInfo is designed** only to display a short note, for example, information
about some configuration, which must only be displayed, read, or copied for
further use and closed. **FSInfo does** not store any information anywhere on
the target computer, such as the position or size of the window. The application
does not require installation on the target computer. It only requires a
**.NET Framework** to run.

Target framework has been changed from **.NET Framework 4.6** in version
**1.0.0.2** to **.NET Framework 4 Client Profile** since version **1.1.0.0** for
backward compatibility with **Windows XP Service Pack 3**.

**FSInfo** is released under the **MIT license**.
